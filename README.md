# Flutter-Google_maps

In this project, I'll show you how to use Google Maps, Directions API, Markers, Location Tracking, and Poly-line Points to create a Flutter app. Users will see a live Google Map where they can track their location and view markers for points of interest. We'll use Flutter, VSCode, Dart, Google Maps API, Directions API, Flutter Location Package, and Flutter Poly-line Points. Whether you're a beginner or experienced, this guide will help you set up Google Maps in your Flutter project for both iOS and Android.
